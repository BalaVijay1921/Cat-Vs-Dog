# Cat-Vs-Dog
The Cat vs Dog CNN project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images as cats or dogs. It processes images through convolutional and pooling layers to learn key visual features, achieving accurate prediction by training on labeled datasets and applying image augmentation techniques.
